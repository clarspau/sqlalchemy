# SQLAlchemy Blogging Application

This repository is for a 3-part exercise aimed at enhancing your proficiency in using SQLAlchemy, specifically focusing on building a blogging application with relational database features.

## Part 1: User Profiles

Develop a blogging application that allows users to create profiles with essential information, such as their first name, last name, and a profile image URL. Each user will be assigned a unique serial user ID automatically.

## Part 2: Adding Posts

Extend the functionality to include blog posts using the one-to-many relationship features of SQLAlchemy. Users can create, edit, and delete multiple blog posts associated with their profiles.

## Part 3: Tagging Feature

The final part introduces a "tagging" feature, exploring the many-to-many relationship in SQLAlchemy. Users can now add, edit, and delte tags to their blog posts, creating a more dynamic and organized content structure.
